**Computational Definition**

The absolute count of discrete copies of a :ref:`Location` or :ref:`Feature`, within a system (e.g. genome, cell, etc.).

**Information Model**

Some CopyNumberCount attributes are inherited from :ref:`Entity`.

      - 0..1
      - The 'logical' identifier of the entity in the system of record, and MUST be represented as a CURIE. This 'id' is unique within a given system, but may also refer to an 'id' for the shared concept in  another system (represented by namespace, accordingly).

      - MUST be "CopyNumberCount"
   *  - subject
      - :ref:`Location` | :ref:`CURIE` | :ref:`Feature`
      - 1..1
      - A location for which the number of systemic copies is described.
   *  - copies
      - :ref:`Number` | :ref:`IndefiniteRange` | :ref:`DefiniteRange`
      - 1..1
      - The integral number of copies of the subject in a system
