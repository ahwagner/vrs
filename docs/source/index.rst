GA4GH Variation Representation Specification
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

.. warning::

   **THIS IS NOT THE OFFICIAL GA4GH VRS DOCUMENTATION!** This is a demonstration build
   for discussing advancements to the maturity model and versioning system for GKS
   specification development. Please refer to https://vrs.ga4gh.org for the GA4GH VRS
   standard.

The Variation Representation Specification (VRS, pronounced "verse") is a standard
developed by the Global Alliance for Genomic Health to facilitate and
improve sharing of genetic information.  The Specification consists of
a JSON Schema for representing many classes of genetic variation,
conventions to maximize the utility of the schema, and a Python
implementation that promotes adoption of the standard.

New in 2.0, additional intro text!
